                                  <p>If an employee experience or witnesses any job-related harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law, or believes that he or she has witnessed or been treated in an unlawful, discriminatory manner, he or she should promptly report the incident to a manger/supervisor, department/division head, or Human Resources.</p>

                                  <h2 class="fs-4 fw-bold"><a id="att">Attendance (including Bad Weather)</a></h2>
                                  <p>The Company expects all employees to be conscientious about attendance and punctuality at work. You are part of a team, and getting the work done depends on everyone being in the right place at the right time. Maintaining good attendance is a condition of employment and an essential function of your job.</p>
                                  <p>Effective 10/01/2016, the <a href="section-4-time-off-benefits.html#pto">PTO (Paid Time Off)</a> days you accrue will replace all existing cation, birthday and floating holidays that you have been allotted under prior policies.</p>
                                  <p>The purpose of Paid Time Off (PTO) is to provide employees with flexible paid time off from work that can be used for such needs a vacation, personal or family illness, doctor appointments, school, or other activities of the employee&#8217;s choice. <em>Doctor&#8217;s notes no longer excuse illnesses so you will no longer need to provide a doctor&#8217;s note for routine sick days. Doctor&#8217;s notes still may be required for extended <a href="section-4-time-off-benefits.html#adia">medical absences (A &amp; S)</a> or to comply with <a href="section-4-time-off-benefits.html#fmla">FMLA</a>.</em></p>
                                  <p>Excessive absenteeism for unapproved or unscheduled time off, as define by departmental need, will lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Other continuing pattern of absences, early departures, or tardiness &#8211; regardless of the exact number of days or hours &#8212; may also warrant disciplinary action. Any falsification of employee time cards, including incorrect reporting of time, will result in discipline, up to and including possinle termination of employment.</p>
                                  <p>We do realize, however, that there are times when absences and tardiness cannot be avoided. Our no-fault system allows you to accumulate some Absentee Hours before any disciplinary action will be taken against you. When scheduling a full day of work, PTO must be used, if available. All other absences not designated as PTO will count towards your Absentee Hours and discipline will be administered as noted below in the Disciplinary Action section. Some Absentee Hours are expected; it is only when Absentee Hours become excessive, that an employee needs to be concerned about this or her attendance practices and job security.</p>
                                  <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Employee Proper Notification/Management Approval</h3>
                                  <p>If you know in advance you are going to be absent from work, you are required to notify your manager/supervisor in writing (e-mail is preferable; texting is NOT permissible) (at least one hour before your normal quit time, the business day prior to the absence. An example would be &#8220;give notice prior to 3:30 pm on Thursday if requesting all or portion of Friday off as vacation, or for a doctor&#8217;s appointment, etc&#8221;). The manger/supervisor will then determine if the time can be approved, based upon workload and based on the number of others already requested off within the department. Not everyone can be gone at the same time. You should not WAIT until the day before to request time off; make your request as soon as you know you want or need time off. Absences that are not approved will be dealt with more seriously and may be subject to discipline outside of the Attendance Policy (for example, someone whose time off request was not approved, but is absent anyway).</p>
                                  <p>If you are ill or some other emergency prevents you from being at work on time or at all and did not allow for opportunity to request the leave the day before, you must telephone (texts are not permitted) your manager/supervisor as soon as possible.</p>
                                  <p>If you do not give any notification and do not show up to work, we will consider it a No Call/No Show and your total hours missed from work will be added to your Absentee Hours. Any employee who fails to report to work without notification to his or her manger/supervisor for a period of three consecutive work days or more will be considered to have voluntarily terminated his or her employment relationship.</p>
                                  <h3 class="wp-block-heading">All absences will count toward your Absentee Hours with the following Exceptions</h3>

                                  <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Attendance Form for Manger/Supervisor to Use</h3>
                                  <p>After an employee has notified a manger/supervisor of a need for leave, the manager/supervisor of a need for leave, the manage/supervisor must report the absence under this this policy using the Attendance Form found on our computer network (in Excel). The form, along with the employee&#8217;s written request, must be forwarded to Human Resources prior to the next pay day.</p>
                                  <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Disciplinary Action</h3>
                                  <p>Unscheduled or unapproved absences from work are considered to be a work-performance problem, which need correction. To that end, everyone has a right to know when repeated absences have reached a point that they are, or could lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Therefore, the Company will generally treat unpaid Absentee Hours in the following manner:</p>
                                  <p><u>Step 1</u>: 24 hours total in previous rolling 12 month period = verbal warning.<br><u>Step 2</u>: 40 hours total in previous rolling 12 month period = written warning.<br><u>Step 3</u>: 56 hours total in previous rolling 12 month period = written warning + 1 day suspension.</p>
                                  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                                    <li class="list-group-item">The day is suspension will be the Company&#8217;s discretion.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Disciplinary suspension hours will be designated as PTO. If PTO is not available, the suspension hours will be unpaid and added to Absentee Hours.</li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p>Step 4: Any future lates/absences in subsequent 12 month period will result in immediate termination.</p>
                                  <p>The same procedure will be followed for active Regular part-time administrative employees with Absentee Hours pro-rated based on their scheduled hours worked per day.</p>
                                  <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Exempt Employees</h3>
                                  <p>Please note that exempt employees&#8217; work hours may vary from department to department. In addition, exempt employees are expected to work at least forty (40) hours in a work week and typically work more after hours, without overtime pay. Exempt employees will be monitored by their management for attendance issues and dealt with on an individual basis, according to this policy.</p>
                                  <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bad Weather</h3>
                                  <p>If there are not DOT warnings or school delays/closings and you are still not comfortable with winter weather conditions and do not want to risk driving, you always have the option of coming in late or staying home.</p>
                                  <p>We recognize that employees may have difficulty reporting to work at times due to ice/snow. We will follow the DOT and school system announcements regarding delays and school closings (in Newton, or your local school system) for employees to avoid hours to their Absentee Hours.</p>
                                  <p>Please be sure to call into the office as you would with any other late or absence. Any hours missed from work will be added to your PTO or Absentee Hours. Please use good judgement and discretion.</p>

                                  <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To communicate The Vernon Company&#8217;s Conflict of Interest policy.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Policy</strong>: A conflict of interest is defined as any situation in which an employee could appear to benefit, at the expense of the Company. Employees should not engage in any business activity that conflicts with, or is contrary to, the interests of The Vernon Company. It is expected that ethical standards will prevent any Vernon employee from providing services or assistance which otherwise could be provided by the Company.</p>
                                  <p>All exempt employees, and those employees who are involved with purchasing, are required to sign a Conflict of Interest Statement on an annual basis. The Corporate Secretary will retain these documents for future reference.</p>
                                  <p>Employees are responsible for reporting any situation they perceive to be a conflict of interest, or any potential conflict of interest, to their manager/supervisor and Human Resources.</p>

                                  <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To provide a fair work environment and to decrease to eliminate issues of conflict, favoritism and employee morale problems as they relate to reporting relationships.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Policy</strong>: It is The Vernon Company&#8217;s policy that relatives of current employees of the Company in a salaried (exempt) or administrative (nonexempt) position may be hired as an employee only if they are will not directly report to or supervise a relative. If already employed, the employee cannot be transferred into such a reporting relationship. If the relative relationship is established after employment begins, the Executive Committee of The Vernon Company will decide who will be transferred where. If that option is not available,  one of the individuals will be required to resign.</p>
                                  <p>It is well accepted that employment of relatives in the same area of an organization can caused serious conflicts with regard of favoritism and employee morale. In these circumstances, all parties, including manager/supervisors, leave themselves open to inequitable issues such as work assignments, transfer opportunities, performance evaluations, promotions, demotions, disciplinary actions, and/or terminations (<a href="section-2-employment.html#sep">separations</a>). In addition environment may be carried to day-to-day working relationships.</p>
                                  <p>In regard to this policy, a relative is defined as: current legal spouse (including common-lay), parent, step-parent, child, step-child, brother (including in-lay), sister (including in-lay), and step-sibling. This policy also applies to individuals who are not legally related but who reside with another employee in a &#8216;significant-other&#8217; relationship (the phrase &#8216;domestic partner&#8217; has been used to describe persons who are also in this type of relationship).</p>
                                  <p>The Executive Committee of The Vernon Company must approve any exception to this policy.</p>

This result does not prevent the prospective employee from later initiating another inquiry with the Company.

A confirmed positive test also constitutes misconduct sufficient to disqualify the test subject from receiving unemployment compensation benefits. At the time the specimen is collected for drug testing, it will be split into two components. If there is a &#8220;positive&#8221; test result reported to the Company by the MRO for the first test, the applicant will be notified in writing of the result through a letter, sent certified mail, return receipt requested.

                                  <p><strong>Policy</strong>: Employees are asked to use good judgement based on their position and professional interactions and dress in a manner appropriate for a professional office environment. In addition, employees need to maintain good personal hygiene habits; perfumes and fragrances should be kept at a minimum. Employees need to use good judgement in how they dress for work. Employees who are not dressed appropriately could be asked to turn the garment inside-out, cover-up, or sent home to change, without pay. If you have questions regarding this policy, contact your manger/supervisor.</p>
                                  <p>Because all casual clothing is not suitable for the office, these guidelines will help you determine what is appropriate to wear to work.</p>

                                  <p>No dress code can cover all contingencies so employees must exert a certain amount of judgement in their choice of clothing to wear to work. If you experience uncertainty about acceptable, professional business attire for work, please ask your supervisor.</p>

                                  <p>The Company recognizes that personal appearance is n important element of self-expression and strives not to control or dictate appropriate employee appearance, specifically with regards to jewelry, tattoos, or unnatural hair color worn as a matter of personal choice.</p>
                                  <p>In keeping with this approach, The Vernon Company allows reasonable self-expression through personal appearance, unless it poses a conflict with the following:</p>
                                  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Employee&#8217;s ability to perform his or her position effectively within his or her specific work environment.</li>

                                  </ul>
                                  <p>If management determines an employee&#8217;s jewelry, unnatural hair color or tattoos may present such a conflict, the employee will be encouraged to identify appropriate options. Such options may include (but not strictly limited to) removal of excess or offensive jewelry, covering of tattoos, changing unnatural hair color, transfer to an alternative position, or other reasonable means to resolve the conflict.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: If clothing fails to meet these standards, as determined by employee&#8217;s manager or HR staff, the employee will be asked not to wear the inappropriate item to work again.</p>
                                  <p>If the problem persists, the employee may be sent home to change clothes and will receive a verbal warning for the first offense. All other policies about personal time use will apply. Progressive disciplinary action will be applied if dress code violations continue.</p>

                                  <p>Communication via e-mail, phone or fax transmitted from The Vernon Company must reflect high standards of professionalism. They should not be used in such as a way as to compromise the company&#8217;s integrity or reputation. E-mail or phone messages are not easily disposed of and deleting a message does not ensure it has been removed from the system. The existence of passwords is not a guarantee of employee privacy. Messages may be discoverable in legal proceedings, including those involving third parties. Consequently, confidentiality cannot be assured. The Vernon Company maintains the right to monitor and access any e-mail or phone messages or other electronic files sent and received. Activities which in any way conflict with this policy can result in discipline, up to and including discharge, or referral to the appropriate legal authorities.</p>

                                  <p><strong>Purpose: </strong>With the increasing popularity of generative AI chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, it has become necessary to outline the proper use of such tools while working at The Vernon Company. While we remain committed to adopting new technologies to aid our mission when possible, we also understand the risks and limitations of generative AI chatbots and want to ensure responsible use. Our goal is to protect employees, account executives, clients, suppliers, customers, and the Company from harm. </p>
                                  <p><strong>Overview: </strong>While AI chatbots can be used to perform a variety of functions, this policy addresses only the use of a web-based interface to ask or “prompt” the chatbot in a conversational manner to find answers to questions or to create or edit written content.</p>
                                  <p>Some examples of what could be created using an AI chatbot include:</p>
                                  
                                  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Emails and letters.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Blog posts, reports and other publications.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Sales and advertising copy.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Policies and job descriptions.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Spreadsheet calculations.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Foreign language translations.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Coding development or debugging.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Document or information sorting.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Outlines or summaries of internal or external information.</li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <br/>
                                  <p>There are, however, risks in using this technology, including uncertainty about who owns the AI-created content and security/privacy concerns with inputting proprietary Company information or sensitive information about an employee, account executive, client, customer, etc., when interacting with the chatbot. Additionally, the accuracy of the content created by these technologies cannot be relied upon, as the information may be outdated, misleading or—in some cases—fabricated.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Eligibility: </strong>This policy applies to all employees of The Vernon Company and to all work associated with The Vernon Company that those employees perform, whether on or off Company premises.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Policy: </strong>Limited use of generative AI chatbots will be allowed while performing work for The Vernon Company with the approval of your Manager. Company email addresses, credentials or phone numbers can be used to create an account with these technologies. No Company data of any kind may be submitted (copied, typed, etc.) into these platforms.</p>
                                  <p>All AI-generated content must be carefully reviewed for accuracy, valid business sense and verified as truthful before relying on it for work purposes. If a reliable source cannot be found to verify factual information generated by the chatbot, that information cannot be used for work purposes. The content must also not infringe on any company’s trademarks, copyrights, patents of proprietary information.</p>
                                  <p>Acceptable uses include:</p>

                                  <p>Any violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Ethical Use: </strong>Employees must use generative AI chatbots in accordance with all The Vernon Company’s conduct and antidiscrimination policies. These technologies must not be used to create content that is inappropriate, discriminatory, or otherwise harmful to others or the Company. Such use will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Monitoring: </strong>The Vernon Company’s Computer Use Policy still applies, and Company reserves the right to monitor and track usage when using generative AI chatbots with Company equipment or on Company networks.</p>

                                  <p>It is recognized that from time to time employees may need to place or receive personal phone calls during working hours. Cellular phones may be used on a limited basis with prior management approval for the situation.

Employees should use discretion and good judgement when making personal calls. (with prior approval) so as not to disturb others. No personal calls are permitted in situations where they would disrupt any business operations. Cellular phones should be turned off(or the ringer silenced), especially in meetings or other situations where noise would be disruptive.</p>
