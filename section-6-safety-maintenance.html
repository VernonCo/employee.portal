                                  <p>If you come to work before 7:00 am (and the parking lot that you usually park in is not cleared of snow), please park in the far east parking lot (in the back, against the warehouse building). Do not park in the center of that lot if it not cleared of snow (please park along the building). You can move your car at your lunch, if needed.</p>
