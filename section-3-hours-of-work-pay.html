In addition, employees are provided with some flexibility in hours for situations that may arise (to be coordinated with their manger/supervisor).</p>

                                  <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To communicate the process for administrative (nonexempt) employees to submit their work time for pay.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Policy/Procedure</strong>: The Federal Wage &amp; Hour Law requires the Company to keep a record of the time each administrative (nonexempt) employee works. To accomplish this, employees must write in and out times at the beginning and end of each work period on time cards provided. After the last entry of the workweek, sign and give your time card to your manger/supervisor for his/her signature. Time cards are required to be <em>signed by both the employee and supervisor/manager before turning in to Payroll. </em>When an administrative (nonexempt) employee does not work eight (8) hours in a day (or their scheduled hours in a day), the manager/supervisor must fill-out an <a href="files/Attendance-Form-Office.xls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Attendance Form</a> (which can be printed from Excel. This form needs to be attached to the employee&#8217;s time card and given to Payroll (also, attach an e-mail with the request for time off from the employee). If you have questions concerning your time card, please contact your manager/supervisor.</p>
                                  <p>A time card is a legal document. Time cards must accurately reflect all time worked. Misrepresentation of time worked or forgery is a violation of the law. Falsification of Company records to include intentional incorrect reporting of time will result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment. An audit of time cards may be conducted at any time at the discretion of the Company, as needed, utilizing the Brivo Access Control Security System.</p>
