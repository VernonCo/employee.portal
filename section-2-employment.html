                                  <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The Vernon Company posts job opening utilizing a variety of resources, including Company bulletin boards, intranet (internal website), internet (external website), recruiters/agencies, and/or other recruiting methods.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Policy</strong>: Internal job postings are placed on Company bulletin boards for approximately three (3) days. In addition, Company positions may be posted on The Vernon Company&#8217;s intranet (internal website).</p>
                                  <p>Employees are eligible to bid on a posted job if they have been in their current position for at least one (1) year. <em>We ask that employees inform their manager/supervisor when and if they are asked to be interviewed for an internal position</em>. Employees who have been employed by the Company for less than one (1) year are eligible to bid on another job position only if their current manager/supervisor approves,  prior to applying. Positions may also be posted externally on The Vernon Company&#8217;s internet (external website), and/or we may use alternative recruiting methods. Resumes are required for all externally posted positions. We prefer that resumes be e-mailed, faxed and/or mailed to Human Resources, rather than individually handling walk-ins. Applicants need to apply for a specific position. (Applications are required for all production position openings, and will be accepted when a specific position is open.) Work Force is an additional source for recruiting externally. Other forms of recruiting may be utilized on an as-needed basis.</p>

                                  <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To receive referrals from House Office employees for potential, qualified and suitable new hires. We will reward current employees who refer individuals who stay with The Vernon Company for six (6) consecutive months or longer.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Policy</strong>: For an employee referral to be valid, a Referral Form must be completed and returned to Human Resources prior to the candidate interviewing. Human Resources will attach this form to the candidate&#8217;s employment application. You will receive a bonus after the new employee who you referred has been employed with The Vernon Company for six (6) consecutive months, and all rules were followed. To receive the bonus, you must be an active employee at the time the new employee reaches the six (6) month mark. You will receive the bonus in a normal paycheck, not in a separate check. There is no limit to the number of qualified people you refer to The Vernon Company. For a current list of position openings and bonus amount details, contact Human Resources. Referral Forms can be obtained in Human Resources. In addition to this Home Office Referral Program, you can participate in the Sales Referral Program to receive bonus dollars. See Sales or Human Resources for further details on the Sales Referral Program.</p>

                                  <p><strong>Policy</strong>: As a standard, new full-time and/or part-time employees will be in an &#8216;orientation period&#8217; for the first sixty (60) days of employment.

                                  <h2 class="fs-4 fw-bold"><a id="rw">Hybrid Work</a></h2>
                                  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The Vernon Company (the “Company”) believes that our business practices are best served when employees are onsite.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company also recognizes that alternative work arrangements such as hybrid arrangements may provide advantages for both the Company and its employees, including, but not limited to:&nbsp; increased productivity and performance, enhanced employee recruitment and retention, cost reduction, and greater work-life balance.&nbsp; In accordance with the guidelines set forth in this Hybrid Work Arrangement Policy, the purpose of this policy is to describe the hybrid work arrangement that may be available to certain employees in appropriate circumstances.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Hybrid Work Arrangement Policy Statement:</strong> This policy addresses hybrid work arrangements.&nbsp; A hybrid work arrangement is appropriate for some employees and some jobs.&nbsp; No employee is entitled to or guaranteed the opportunity to hybrid work.&nbsp; Certain categories of positions or departments are ineligible for hybrid work arrangements. The Company reserves the right to approve or deny a hybrid work arrangement request, and to modify or revoke such arrangement at its sole discretion.</p>
                                  <p>The current hybrid policy is to work at least two days in the office per week, which must be agreed upon with the manager.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Eligibility: </strong>Current employees in good standing requesting a hybrid/remote work arrangement should be employed by the Company for a minimum of 12 months of continuous, regular employment. Exceptions to this rule may be made at the discretion of the Manager and Human Resources.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Eligible Positions for Hybrid/Remote Work:</strong> When evaluating whether the duties of a particular position may be performed hybrid/remotely, the supervisor should consider the following:</p>
                                  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Nature of the work and responsibilities to be performed are conducive to a hybrid/remote work location without causing disruption to performance or service;</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">The needs of the department to advance its core mission and the needs of the department to fulfill its role in that mission: including frequency of meetings and department goals and projects;</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Other collaborating departments’ needs and schedules;</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Whether or not daily face-to-face in-person interaction is required of the position;</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">The job does not require onsite employee supervision.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">An excellent level of service can be maintained without hardship on collaborating departments and co-workers.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">Identification of a backup to monitor the hybrid/remote worker in the supervisor’s absence.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">The performance of the employee.</li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <br/>
                                  <p><strong>General Expectations and Conditions: </strong>Employee job duties and responsibilities will not change due to a hybrid work arrangement.&nbsp; Professionalism in terms of job responsibilities, work output, and service delivery will continue to follow the standards set by the Company.&nbsp; The employee must be able to maintain performance, productivity, and quality standards.&nbsp; Employees must be fully accessible during agreed upon work hours.&nbsp;</p>
                                  <p>Managers may require employees working a hybrid work arrangement to report to the central workplace as needed for work-related meetings or other events, office coverage, or as needed to discuss work progress or other work-related issues.&nbsp; Employees are expected to perform their work during core or agreed hybrid work hours and should be available through email and phone, just as if they were in the office. Reasonable amounts of time for breaks and meal breaks are permitted. In the event that an employee loses their internet coverage, and it continues for one hour, the employee is expected to report to the Company for the remainder of their scheduled workday. Employees must notify their supervisor/manager immediately if this situation arises. If it is found an employee is not performing work during the core or agreed hybrid work hours, the hybrid work arrangement may be terminated, and the employee may be subject to discipline.</p>
