                                  <p><strong>Example 4</strong>: Full-time employee took PTO time off work on work day immediately preceding the holiday (July 4<sup>th</sup>). PTO was NOT prior scheduled. Employee worked 6 hours on July 3<sup>rd</sup> rather than 8 hours.</p>

                                  <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To provide a paid-time-off benefit which will provide a break in routine and will support The Vernon Company&#8217;s goal to attract and retain quality employees.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Policy</strong>: The Vernon Company recognizes the importance of flexible paid time off from work. Paid Time Off (PTO) provides you the flexibility to use your time off to meet your personal needs, while recognizing your individual responsibility to manage your paid time off. The Company does not pay in lieu of PTO. All PTO requests are subject to approval by your manager/supervisor and proper notice should be given, when possible (see Attendance Policy for details). PTO pay is based on your pay rate at the time PTO is taken. <em>(Note: PTO does not accrue while an employee is on an unpaid leave, unpaid FMLA, A &amp; S, or Worker&#8217;s Compensation leave).</em></p>
                                  <p>Employees may use time from their PTO bank, in 30 minute increments. Time that is not covered by the PTO policy, and for which separate guidelines and policies exist, include Company paid holidays, bereavement time off, required jury duty, and military service leave. Employees may carry over unused PTO time from one PTO year to the next. The maximum amount of PTO that an employee may carry over from one year to the next is 40 hours. Unused PTO in excess of 40 hours, after May 31<sup>st</sup>, is forfeited. The maximum PTO carry over allowed for part-time employees will be pro-rated.</p>

                                  <p>The PTO year runs from June 1<sup>st</sup> through May 31<sup>st</sup>. All PTO will be tracked by Human Resources for administrative (nonexempt) employees. When requesting PTO, an e-mail should be sent with proper notice to the manger/supervisor by the employee. The manager/supervisor will then review for approval, complete an <a href="files/Attendance-Form-Office.xls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Attendance Form</a>, and attach the information to the employee&#8217;s time card. For administrative (nonexempt) new hires with less than one (1) year of continuous service, a pro-rated PTO amount will be calculated to be used before the first June 1<sup>st</sup> (following a 60 day waiting period from date of hire). On the first June 1<sup>st</sup> after date of hire, another pro-rated PTO amount is earned. </p>

The Vernon Company&#8217;s Executive Assistant will track Officer&#8217;s PTO (and other absences). When requesting PTO, send an e-mail (or <a href="#">Out of Plant Notice</a>) with proper notice to your manager/supervisor. The manager/supervisor will then review for approval and forward to Human Resources for tracking. For salaried (exempt) new hires and current salaried employees <em>with less than one (1) year of continuous service</em> on March 1<sup>st</sup>, a pro-rated PTO amount will be calculated.</p>

                                  <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To provide unpaid time off for personal reasons, other than for A &amp; S (Accident &amp; Sickness) or FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act), which consists of eleven (11) or more consecutive working days. <em>(Notes: Personal unpaid time off, requested for ten (10) or less consecutive working days would fall under the <a href="section-5-employee-conduct.html#att">Attendance Policy</a> section of this handbook and would be considered &#8216;Personal Time Off&#8217; on the Attendance Form)</em>.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Policy</strong>: Employees may be granted an unpaid leave of absence to attend to personal matters. Leave of absence requests must be made at least thirty (30) days in advance of the date the employee would like the leave to begin, or in emergency situations, with as much advance notice as possible, using the Company&#8217;s &#8216;Leave of Absence Request Form&#8217;. (Normally, advance notice should be within at least two (2) business days of when the need for the leave becomes known to the employee). This request must be submitted to the employee&#8217;s manager/supervisor and Human Resources. Human Resources and management will determine if leave away from the job will be in the best interest of the employee and The Vernon Company. (Granting a leave of absence is wholly within the discretion of management). If granted, a leave of absence will be determined for a specific time, typically for eleven (11) or more consecutive working days, and will require a date of return.</p>
                                  <p>Employees on an approved leave of absence will be eligible for continued insurance coverage by paying the regular employee contribution for a leave of absence lasting thirty (30) days or less in a twelve (12) month period. For a leave of absence lasting more than thirty (30) days, employees will also pay the premium equal to the company cost. <em>Vacation will not accrue during any unpaid period of the leave, and personal days (floaters/birthday/holiday) will not carry over while an employee is on a leave or when the employee returns.</em></p>
                                  <p>Unless applicable law requires otherwise, reinstatement will not be guaranteed to any employee requesting a personal leave under this section. However, the Company will endeavor to place employees returning from leave in their former position or a position comparable in status and pay, subject to budgetary restrictions and the Company&#8217;s need to fill vacancies, and its ability to find qualified temporary replacements.</p>
                                  <p>All questions regarding leave of absence and the applicable from should be directed to Human Resources.</p>

                                  <p>Leaves will be granted for a period of up to twelve weeks (or up to 26 weeks in the case of care for a service member, as discussed below) in any twelve-month period. The twelve-month period is a rolling period, measured from the date qualifying leave is first taken.</p>
                                  <p>An employee must have completed at least twelve months of service with the Company <em>and </em>have worked a minimum of 1,250 hours in the twelve-month period preceding the leave to be eligible for such leave. Service prior to a break in service of less than seven years will be counted in determining whether the employee has completed at least twelve months of service with the Company. Service prior to a break in service lasting seven years or more will be counted only when the break in service has been caused by the fulfillment of USSERRA-covered service obligations.</p>
                                  <p>Employees who do not meet these requirements may apply for a leave of absence subject to the conditions described in Part B of this policy or under the Accident and Sickness (A &amp; S) policy, as applicable.</p>
                                  <p class="text-align-center"><em><u>Scope of Child/Family Care/ Military Exigency Leave</u></em></p>
                                  <p>You may request a leave of absence to care for a child after birth, or placement in your home for adoption or foster care. An employee’s entitlement to leave for a birth or placement for adoption or foster care expires at the end of a 12-month period beginning on the date of birth or placement.</p>
                                  <p>You may also request a leave of absence to care for a covered family member with a serious health condition (as defined below). A covered family member is a spouse; a biological, adoptive, step or foster parent, but not an “in law”; a biological, adoptive, step or foster child, or legal ward who is under age 18, or who is 18 or older and incapable of self- care because of a mental or physical disability at the time that FMLA leave is to commence.</p>
                                  <p>You may also request a leave of absence because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the spouse, or a son, daughter, or parent of the employee is a member of any branch of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves on covered active duty in a foreign country (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty in a foreign country). A qualifying military exigency means: (a) short-notice deployment (up to seven days of leave if the military member receives seven or less days’ notice of a call to active duty); (b) military events and related activities; (c) certain temporary or alternative childcare arrangements and school activities (excluding ongoing regular childcare); (d) making or updating financial and legal arrangements to address the service member’s absence resulting from active duty status; (e) counseling by a non-medical counselor, such as a member of the clergy, arising from the active duty or call to active duty; (f) rest and recuperation (up to fifteen days of leave when the military member is on short-term, temporary rest and recuperation leave); and/or (g) parental care leave for a military member’s parent who is incapable of self-care when the change in care is necessitated by the member’s covered active duty; and/or (h) post- deployment military activities.</p>
                                  <p class="text-align-center"><em><u>Leave for Employee&#8217;s Serious Health Condition</u></em></p>
                                  <p>You may request a leave of absence in the event that your own serious health condition renders you unable to perform the functions of your position. An employee is unable to perform the functions of his or her position when the employee either cannot work at all or is unable to perform any one of the essential functions of his or her position within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act. An employee who must be absent to receive medical treatment for a serious health condition is considered to be unable to perform the essential functions of the position during the absence for treatment.</p>
                                  <p class="text-align-center"><em><u>Serious Health Condition Defined</u></em></p>
                                  <p>The Family &amp; Medical Leave Act broadly describes a serious health condition as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provider.</p>
                                  <p>The term &#8220;continuing treatment&#8221; is defined in the Department of Labor regulations as including five different scenarios:</p>

A “covered service member” means a member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious illness or injury, which either existed prior to the beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by service in the line or duty or was incurred in the line of duty on active duty that may render the service member medically unfit to perform the duties of his or her office, grade, rank or rating for which the service member is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy.</p>

                                  <p>Leave taken to care for a child after birth or placement in your home for adoption or foster care must be taken in consecutive workweeks.

If the Company receives incomplete, vague, ambiguous or non-responsive medical certifications, the Company will notify you of the problems with the certification and provide you seven</p>
                                  <p>(7) days to cure any deficiency unless not practicable under the circumstances. If the deficiencies are not cured within that time frame, the Company may contact the health care provider directly for clarification or authentication purposes or the FMLA leave may be denied.</p>
                                  <p>If management determines that a second medical opinion is required, management may, at its own expense, require you to obtain a second opinion from a health care provider designated by the Company. If the first and second opinions do not agree, management may, at its own expense, require you to obtain a third opinion from a health care provider agreed upon by both you and management. The opinion of the third health care provider is final. However, in the case of certification of a serious injury or illness for military caregiver leave, second opinions may be required only if the initial certification was not made by an authorized DOD/VA affiliated healthcare provider.</p>

                                    <li class="list-group-item">Your dependent who is under age thirteen (13) and for whom you can claim an exemption</li>

                                  <p>To be eligible, you must be working (or looking for work) while your dependents receive care. Also, if you are marries, your spouse must be; a wage earner, a full-time student for at least five (5) months (need not be consecutive) during the year, or disabled and unable to provide for his or her own care. IRS regulations limit the annual amount you can contribute to the dependent care account to $5,000 for a single parent with children, $5,000 for a married parent filing jointly, and $2,500 for a married parent filing separately.</p>
                                  <p>If you choose to take advantage of this benefit, you will need to estimate the amount of qualifying day care expenses for the upcoming calendar year, and enroll (each ear) by completing a <a href="#">Flexible Benefits Plan Election and Compensation Reduction Agreement</a> provided by Human Resources. The total amount will be withheld throughout the year from your payroll check in fifty-two (52) or twelve (12) installments will depend on the remaining number of pay periods left in the calendar year. <strong><em>Use caution in estimating because according to IRS rules, any unused amount withheld from your payroll checks are forfeited at the end of the calendar year. In addition, the amount withheld cannot be changed during the calendar year unless you have a left status change (see Human Resources for a list of qualifying &#8216;life events&#8217;).</em></strong></p>
                                  <p>After you have paid daycare expenses, you will need to complete a <a href="#">Dependent Care Reimbursement Form</a>. This form needs to be sent to Human Resources, either with your receipt(s), or have it signed/dated by your day care provider. After Human Resources receives all necessary information, you will be issued a check from your (FSA) flexible spending account. If funds are not available because enough has not been taken from your paychecks, your information will be held until the money is available to be reimbursed.</p>
                                  <p>You are required to provide the name, address, and social security number (or other taxpayer ID number) of your day care provider on your federal income tax forms at year-end. Reimbursement of child care expenses is determined based on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules, and all of those rules are not included in this policy and purpose.</p>

                                  <p>Under IRS regulations, qualified individuals can receive a tax credit for dependent care costs. This credit can be claimed on your personal tax return. You cannot claim the tax credit for any dependent care costs reimbursed from the Dependent Care Reimbursement Account. The maximum amount that can be used for the tax credit is reduced by the amount you use from the Dependent Care Reimbursement Account.

Our plan custodian is <a href="https://www.principal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Principle Life Insurance Company</a> of Des Moines, IA. All home office employees (age 19 or older) are eligible to defer into the plan and receive Company matching contributions the first January 1<sup>st</sup> or July 1<sup>st</sup> following six (6) months of service. Once employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan, they will be set to automatically defer into the plan at 6%. If you do not wish to defer into the plan, you must complete an enrollment form indicating a different percentage. Employees may choose to contribute on a pre-tax basis, 0 to 100% of their pay each pay period, after payroll taxes and al other deductions are met.</p>
                                  <p>Salary deferrals into the 401(k) plan will reduce taxable income for federal and state taxes. The Vernon Company will match 25% of the first 6% of the pay you contribute in this plan through salary deferral. In addition, a discretionary contribution may be made annually to those participants who are considered active participants on December 31<sup>st</sup>.</p>
                                  <p>The purpose of the plan is to allow eligible employees to enhance their retirement benefits.
